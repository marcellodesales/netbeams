# What is NetBEAMS

NetBEAMS (Networked Bay Environmental Assessment Monitoring System) is the primary system automation project used to assist the process of data collection from sensor networks such as SF-BEAMS. It's primary focus is environmental sensor networks, but it can be used in different sensor networks.

This was a research project at San Francisco State University, developed at Google Code (https://code.google.com/archive/p/netbeams/). Migration steps was performed at https://gist.github.com/yancyn/3f870ca6da4d4a5af5618fbd3ce4dd13#gistcomment-3443510.
