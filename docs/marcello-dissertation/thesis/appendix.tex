\appendix{Appendix A: Triangulations of Polytopes}

This creates an appendix, which is not numbered (and therefore has to be added to the table of contents semi-manually).

For code, the {\tt verbatim} environment (maybe in conjunction with $\backslash${\tt include}) is helpful:

\begin{verbatim}
It reproduces text
  exactly
    as
      it
        is
typed.
\end{verbatim}

Good luck and enjoy writing!
