\section{Design Model For Sensor Networks}

Sensor Networks are specialized types of network systems comprised of network 
nodes with specific goals to observe and collect data. The following
subsections describe classes of characteristis of these types of sensor
networks, with applications on research, industrial or militery.

\subsection{Strengths as compared to literature}

\subsection{Weaknesses as compared to literature}

\section{Data-Centric Storage and Database Shards}

Horizontal scalability for data based on specific keys.

\subsection{Scalability facing High Volume of Collected Data}

Adding new shards as new hardware into the cluster, facing increasing data load
produced by the sensor network.

\subsection{Weakness}

Technological, and skills-based.
